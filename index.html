                    Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It
                    has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt
                    snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth
                    is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant
                    bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at
                    birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the
                    nutrient-rich seeds contained within.</p>
